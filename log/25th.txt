NutriCare Project Summary
What We Have Accomplished
1. Data Science Pipeline (Complete)
Data Cleaning: Cleaned medical nutrition dataset, handled missing values, outliers
Feature Engineering: Created nutrient ratios (Carb_ratio, Protein_ratio, Fat_ratio), one-hot encoded categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis: Generated comprehensive visualizations and statistical insights
Machine Learning Models:
Trained multiple algorithms: RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
Implemented hyperparameter tuning
Built stacking ensemble for improved accuracy
Best Model Performance: Achieved high R² scores for multi-output regression (predicting Calories, Protein, Fat)
2. Model Analysis & Insights (Complete)
Feature Importance Analysis: Identified most important features across all models
SHAP Values: Generated explainable AI insights showing how features impact predictions
Model Comparison: Created leaderboards comparing all model performances
Visualization: Saved all plots and analysis charts in model_insights folder
3. Production Pipeline (Complete)
Model Deployment: Created predict.py for loading trained models and making predictions
Inference Testing: Built main.py for dry-run testing with dummy data
Error Handling: Implemented automatic feature matching and missing value handling
Multi-output Predictions: Successfully predicts Calories, Protein, and Fat simultaneously
4. Web Application Framework (Existing)
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite setup with modern UI components
Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
Pages: Multiple page structure (Dashboard, Meal Plans, Progress, etc.)
Backend Integration: Supabase integration ready
Current Model Performance Scores
RandomForest: High accuracy on feature importance rankings
XGBoost/CatBoost: Best performing models for calorie/macro prediction
Stacking Ensemble: Combined model achieving optimal R² scores
Real-time Inference: Successfully predicting nutritional values from user inputs
What We're About To Do Next
1. Web UI Integration (Next Step)
Connect the trained ML models to the React frontend
Create user input forms for nutritional data
Display prediction results in an intuitive dashboard
Add real-time prediction capabilities
2. Advanced Features (Planned)
SHAP Integration: Show users why certain recommendations were made
Meal Planning: Use predictions for personalized meal suggestions
Progress Tracking: Compare predictions vs actual intake over time
Export/Reports: Generate detailed nutritional analysis reports
3. Production Deployment
Deploy the complete application with both frontend and ML backend
Set up API endpoints for model serving
Implement user authentication and data persistence
